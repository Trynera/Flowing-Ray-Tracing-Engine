# FREe (**F**lowing **R**ay Tracing **E**ngin**e**)
A Ray Tracer written with C++ and Vulkan

This is something I am writting for fun! I want to eventually use this to make games.

I'm currently prototyping with OpenGL and got following features working:

- [x] Global Illumnination
- [x] Ray-Triangle intersection
- [x] Loading 3D models
- [ ] Loading materials
- [ ] Texture support
- [ ] HDR support
- [x] Ray-AABB intersection (Ray-Box intersection)
- [x] implement SAH BVH (and look into speeding up construction)
- [ ] implement ReSTIR (and look into implementing Area ReSTIR)
- [ ] implement a Denoiser (A-SVGF)
