# FREe (**F**lowing **R**ay Tracing **E**ngin**e**)
A Ray Tracer written with C++ and Vulkan

This is something I am writting for fun! I want to eventually use this to make games.

I'm currently prototyping with OpenGL and plan to get following features working:

- [x] --Global Illumnination--
- [x] --Ray-Triangle intersection--
- [x] --Loading 3D models--
- [ ] Loading materials
- [ ] Texture support
- [ ] HDR support
- [x] --Ray-AABB intersection (Ray-Box intersection)--
- [x] --implement SAH BVH (and look into speeding up construction)--
- [ ] implement ReSTIR (and look into implementing Area ReSTIR)
- [ ] implement a Denoiser (A-SVGF)
